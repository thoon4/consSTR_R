## Abstract

Although objects in our daily experiences have high complexity, we recognize them easily. For this efficient object recognition, our brain needs to represent structures of visual objects: the brain needs to parse objects into essential constituents and identify their relationships. How does the brain represent structures? Based on memory consolidation theories, we tested a hypothesis that the visual cortex gets to represent structures of visual objects through a consolidation period using an fMRI study. In the first phase, participants were exposed to syllables made of a combination of two different artificial letters (GA = G +A, DO = D + O). In the second session, LOC activation patterns were recorded while participants were exposed to new syllables made of a novel combination of the familiar letters (GO, DA). Lastly, we collected LOC activation patterns of the individual letters (O, G, D, A). Crucially, there was a week delay between the first and the second phases for the consolidation condition, while the control condition had no such delay. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a greater LOC activation level for the syllables of the consolidation vs. the control condition. More importantly, activation patterns for syllables of the consolidation condition were better explained by the patterns of their constituent letters compared to the control condition. These results support the hypothesis that the visual cortex figures out structures of visual objects through a consolidation process. More interestingly, our study suggests that the structured representation is the basis of efficient comprehension of novel experiences.
